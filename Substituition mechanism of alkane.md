The substitution mechanism of alkanes mainly involves **free radical substitution**, which occurs in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light or heat. This is common in reactions like the halogenation of alkanes. The mechanism follows three distinct steps: **Initiation, Propagation, and Termination**.

### **1. Initiation (Formation of Free Radicals)**
- A halogen molecule (e.g., Cl₂ or Br₂) absorbs UV light or heat.
- This causes **homolytic fission**, breaking the bond evenly to form two halogen radicals (•Cl or •Br).

### **2. Propagation (Radical Chain Reaction)**
This step involves two main reactions:

- **First Propagation Step:**  
  A halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a new alkyl radical.

- **Second Propagation Step:**  
  The alkyl radical reacts with another halogen molecule, forming a haloalkane and regenerating the halogen radical.

- The cycle continues, leading to further substitution.

### **3. Termination (Stopping the Reaction)**
The reaction stops when radicals combine to form stable molecules:

### **Key Points:**
- Requires **UV light** or **heat**.
- Follows a **free radical mechanism**.
- Can lead to **multiple substitutions** (e.g., CH₃Cl → CH₂Cl₂ → CHCl₃ → CCl₄).
- Common in halogenation reactions of alkanes.
