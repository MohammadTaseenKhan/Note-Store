**Path difference** refers to the difference in the distance traveled by two waves from their respective sources to a common point. It plays a crucial role in interference and diffraction phenomena.  

### **Formula:**  
\[
\Delta x = d_1 - d_2
\]  
where:  
- \( \Delta x \) = path difference  
- \( d_1 \) = distance traveled by the first wave  
- \( d_2 \) = distance traveled by the second wave  

### **Relation to Interference:**  
- **Constructive Interference:** Occurs when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength:  
  \[
  \Delta x = n\lambda, \quad n = 0, 1, 2, \dots
  \]  
- **Destructive Interference:** Occurs when the path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength:  
  \[
  \Delta x = (2n+1) \frac{\lambda}{2}, \quad n = 0, 1, 2, \dots
  \]  

### **Examples:**  
1. **Young's Double-Slit Experiment:** The interference fringes depend on the path difference between the two waves arriving at a point.  
2. **Diffraction Gratings:** The constructive and destructive interference patterns depend on the difference in the optical path between adjacent slits.  
3. **Thin Film Interference:** Path difference due to reflection from different surfaces leads to color variations in thin films like soap bubbles.
