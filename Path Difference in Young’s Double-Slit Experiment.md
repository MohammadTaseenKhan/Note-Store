### **Path Difference in Young’s Double-Slit Experiment**  

In **Young’s Double-Slit Experiment**, two coherent light waves from slits **S₁** and **S₂** interfere to form a pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes on a screen. The **path difference** between these two waves determines whether the interference is **constructive** or **destructive**.  

#### **1. Path Difference Formula**  
The path difference Δx at any point **P** on the screen is given by:

If the slits are separated by a distance **d**, the point **P** is at a distance **y** from the central axis, and the screen is at a distance **D** from the slits, the path difference can be approximated as:

(for small angles, using the small-angle approximation sin ⁡θ ≈ θ)

#### **2. Conditions for Interference**  
- **Constructive Interference (Bright Fringe):**

  (Waves arrive **in phase**, reinforcing each other.)  

- **Destructive Interference (Dark Fringe):**

  (Waves arrive **out of phase**, canceling each other.)

#### **3. Fringe Spacing (Fringe Width)**
The **distance between two adjacent bright or dark fringes** (fringe width) is:

where:  
- *w* = fringe width  
- *λ* = wavelength of light  
- *D* = distance from slits to screen  
- *d* = distance between the two slits  

This equation shows that increasing the wavelength or moving the screen farther away increases fringe separation, while increasing the slit separation decreases fringe width.

#### **4. Central Maximum and Higher-Order Fringes**  
- The **central maximum** (n = 0) corresponds to **zero path difference**.  
- **First-order maximum (n = 1):** The waves from the two slits differ in path by **one full wavelength**.  
- **Second-order maximum (n = 2):** The path difference is **two wavelengths**, and so on.
