A **skeletal formula** (also called a **line-angle formula**) is a simplified way of representing organic molecules in chemistry. It omits carbon and hydrogen atoms, showing only bonds and heteroatoms (like oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, etc.). Here are the key points:

1. **Carbon Atoms are Implied**: At the ends and intersections of lines.
2. **Hydrogen Atoms are Omitted**: Assumed to be present to satisfy carbon’s valency.
3. **Heteroatoms are Explicitly Shown**: Oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, etc.
4. **Double and Triple Bonds are Shown**: Using double and triple lines.

For example:
- **Ethane (C₂H₆)** → A simple line.
- **Benzene (C₆H₆)** → A hexagon with alternating double bonds.
- **Ethanol (C₂H₅OH)** → A line with "OH" at the end.
