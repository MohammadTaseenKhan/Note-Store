The **A-Level Edexcel Physics** course follows the Pearson Edexcel specification and is designed to provide students with a strong understanding of fundamental physics principles, mathematical applications, and practical skills.  

### **Course Structure**  
The course is divided into two levels:  
- **AS Level (Year 1)**  
- **A2 Level (Year 2)**  

Both levels together form the full **International Advanced Level (IAL) Physics** qualification.
